            <h1>About Me</h1><br>
            <p><b>For the world, WWW meant world wide web; for me it means Work. Worth. Wonders.</b><br>
                    "Experience of working on more than 850 websites. Nearly 13years invested in IT sector. Holding forte in eCommerce website development. Expertise in Payment Gateway industry solutions. Enthusiasm and creativity in galore for Social Media Management."
                    <br><br>
                    Would it be justified if I use any other words than Work. Worth. Wonders to describe my profile!
                    <br><br>
                    It is through this WWW that I have contributed maximum to the world; in the form of IT solutions, websites, analytics, software applications and consultancy, mobile application ideas, blogging, social media management, hosting, developing, SEO advisory and doing all that which would help leverage an individual or company gain maximum out of IT.
                    <br><br>
                    Beginning my journey as a dot net developer, it was my keenness to learn new things and technologies that brought me today to the level of being IT head for a Multi-national company. 
                    <br><br>
                    Being a thought leader in IT, I started early enough and hence took a lead in being a prime mover for digital communication solutions. While people were busy bragging about their multiple email ids, I took the opportunity to make my own website and work with commitment.
                    <br><br>
                    While achievements for me have been many, like I have worked as social media expert for many political parties ad handled the work profile of being a senior IT consultant for TV Channels as well as media groups... my goal has remained the same in last 13years. I strive to innovate and inspire with cutting edge IT solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    I am different. What distinguishes me from the rest is my commitment and agility. If I have promised to provide your business with the most advanced and quality products and services, I will deliver more than your expectations and on time. These solutions, along with the industry's coveted customer support and services will be highly personalized.
                    <br><br>
                    I am agile enough to flow in sync with the ever-changing world of technology. I was not even a teenager when Tim Berners-Lee launched the first website in 1991. But today, I am one of the first ones to get information about all that’s happening in the world of IT. If a software or application comes new in the market, I am the first one to be reading about it and investing time and resources to train myself in its usage.
                    <br><br>
